The CSK App is built using the [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) framework, and manages all the dependencies the end user needs, meaning they will not have to install [AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/), [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/), or use the command line. The requirements to use the AWS Console are also minimal.

The app allows you to 

* deploy [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) templates,
* bootstrap an account for CDK, 
* install [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html) apps using [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/) and [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/), 
* use the [SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/) to make calls into the account, 

all from within the CSK app environment.
